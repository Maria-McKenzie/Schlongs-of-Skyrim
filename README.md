## Schlongs of Skyrim â€” The Mod That Quietly Changes the Whole Skyrim Experience

**âž¤âž¤âž¤ [Download Schlongs of Skyrimâ€‹ Free](https://goo.su/gRqOyvy)**

Hey, so I tried out this mod that honestly seemed a bit weird at first â€” it's called **Schlongs of Skyrim**, or just **SOS**. But once I figured it out, I realized it's not just a visual mod â€” it's basically a **custom male body framework** that turns Skyrim into a completely new experience.

What SOS does is replace the vanilla male body with custom meshes that support physics, animations, and advanced customization. But the real magic is that **it acts as a foundation** â€” other mods like armors, HD textures, RaceMenu sliders, physics plugins â€” they all hook into it. You install one core mod, and suddenly you've unlocked an entire ecosystem of customization.

## What I Liked About It (For Real)

First, **it's super customizable**. Through the in-game MCM menu, you can pick a body model, toggle auto-generation, and make it work with armor mods. It also works flawlessly with **RaceMenu**, so you can edit everything via sliders. And with **BodySlide**, you can generate armor meshes that actually match the custom body â€” especially if you're using UNP, CBBE, or 3BA-based setups.

And despite its NSFW reputation, SOS is really just **a technical backbone**. Tons of other mods â€” even ones with fully clothed characters â€” require SOS for proper animation rigging or armor fitting. Without it, a bunch of high-end armor mods wonâ€™t even align properly in-game.

## What You Need to Run It

If you want to try it out, hereâ€™s the basic setup I used:

* **SKSE64** â€“ the script extender, essential for all advanced Skyrim mods
* **RaceMenu** â€“ to access custom sliders and body settings
* **XPMSSE** â€“ the extended skeleton required for full animation compatibility
* **BodySlide & Outfit Studio** â€“ to generate armor that fits your custom body
* **FNIS or Nemesis** â€“ so your animations stay synced and functional
* **SkyUI** â€“ needed to open the MCM configuration menu

The setup isnâ€™t too hard, especially if you're using Mod Organizer 2 â€” just follow the load order: dependencies first, then SOS, then the rest.

---

## Why Even Use It?

The coolest part is how **alive** your characters feel with this setup. SOS adds body logic, parameters, reactions, and real-time outfit fitting. Even armor looks and fits differently. If you're into character creation and want Skyrim to feel like a true RPG with deep body customization â€” this mod is hypothetically a must-have. Not for the visuals, but for **control and flexibility**.

## ðŸ”„ One-Click Installation

By the way, the best part â€” **all the required mods are bundled into a single installer file**. You donâ€™t have to download everything manually, adjust settings, or chase down matching versions. Just grab the file from this repository, launch the installer â€” and everything sets up **automatically**: SKSE, XPMSSE, RaceMenu, BodySlide, FNIS/Nemesis, and SOS itself. Fully pre-configured and tested.
